## Key Terms Glossary
- **Diploid**: Having two copies of each gene, one from each parent.
- **Haploinsufficiency**: When one working gene copy is insufficient, causing an abnormal trait or disease.
- **Haplosufficiency**: When one working gene copy is sufficient for normal function.
- **Loss-of-Function (LoF)-Tolerant Genes**: Genes that can be inactivated by PTVs without causing harm, often due to redundancy.
- **Gene Dosage**: The amount of protein produced by a gene’s copies.
- **Fitness**: The ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment.
- **Exome**: The part of the genome that codes for proteins.
- **pLI (Probability of Being Loss-of-Function Intolerant)**: A score (0 to 1) where high values (≥0.9) indicate a gene is sensitive to PTVs, likely haploinsufficient.
- **LOEUF (Loss-of-Function Observed/Expected Upper-bound Fraction)**: A score where low values (<0.35) show a gene has fewer PTVs than expected, indicating haploinsufficiency.
- **LOFTEE**: A tool that filters out incorrect PTVs for accurate data.
- **Natural Selection**: The process where traits that improve survival and reproduction are passed on, while harmful traits are less likely to persist.
- **Purifying Selection**: A type of natural selection that removes harmful mutations, like PTVs in haploinsufficient genes, to maintain fitness.
- **Fitness**: The ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment.
- **Loss-of-Function (LoF)-Tolerant Genes**: Genes that can be inactivated by PTVs without harming health, often due to redundancy.
