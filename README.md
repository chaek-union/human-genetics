## About This Book

This digital textbook introduces the foundations and frontiers of **human genetics** — from Mendel’s early concept of *heritable factors* to the era of genome sequencing and large-scale cohort-based discovery. It is designed for undergraduate biology and biomedical students who wish to understand not only the facts of genetics, but the evolving **perspectives** that have shaped the field.  

**Please note that the chapters are currently under writing and improvement. The full version is expected to be completed around January next year.**
