<h2 id="science-is-the-evolving-perspective">Science Is the Evolving Perspective</h2>
<p>Science is not about memorizing termsâit is about <em>how our perspectives evolve.</em> Biology has advanced not because new words were invented, but because scientists began to <em>see the same phenomena differently.</em></p>
<p>Genetics shows this clearly. Over the past 150 years, what we call an "allele" has evolved from an invisible "factor" to a measurable <strong>variant</strong>. Each generation of discovery didn't erase the previous oneâit <strong>expanded</strong> what "allele" could mean, revealing new layers of how inheritance works.</p>

<p>This journeyâfrom invisible "factors" to molecular information, and now to measurable <strong>variation</strong>âmarks one of the most profound transformations in biology. To study genetics is not simply to learn definitions, but to follow how scientists have <strong>redefined what it means to inherit information</strong>.</p>
<p>Many students arrive at university after years of exam preparationâlearning to memorize concepts and reproduce them accurately. Memorization often dominated science classes too. But modern biology evolves rapidly as new data emerge daily. Because biology interprets natural phenomena, our understanding shifts as new evidence accumulates. What matters most is not remembering every term, but learning to interpret data and think about the principles that best explain life <em>right now.</em></p>
<p>In this textbook, we'll examine essential concepts through key scientific papers and explore how they're applied in real research. By connecting historical discoveries to current examples, you'll see how biological understanding grows through evidence and reinterpretation.</p>
<p>Science advances when perspectives evolveâand your own research may one day become part of that evolution.</p>
<hr></hr>
<h2 id="beyond-memorizationâunderstanding-the-paradigm">Beyond MemorizationâUnderstanding the Paradigm</h2>
<p>For many of us, biology has been taught as a list of terms to memorize. But science is not a dictionary; it is a <strong>framework for seeing differently</strong>. Every generation of scientists inherits not only data, but also a <strong>paradigm</strong>âa shared way of interpreting the world.</p>
<p>A <em>paradigm</em> defines what counts as a question, what methods are trusted, and what explanations are considered meaningful. When technology changesâfrom microscopes to sequencing to AIâthose rules shift. Progress in science is often not a single discovery, but a <strong>change in how we recognize and organize knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider when Mendel's invisible "factors" became visible as chromosomes, when the central dogma reframed the gene as information rather than substance, and when the Human Genome Project transformed biology into a data science. These weren't just new factsâthey were <strong>new ways of thinking</strong> about the same reality.</p>
<h3 id="from-memorization-to-creation">From Memorization to Creation</h3>
<p>In Korean education, memorization and giving the "correct" answer have long been valued above all else. But as you begin your journey as scientists, your role will shiftâfrom <em>knowledge consumers</em> to <em>knowledge producers</em>. Most research questions have <strong>no predefined answers</strong>. You must learn to express your understanding in <strong>your own language</strong>, to build arguments, interpret data, and communicate ideas that may not yet have names.</p>
<p>Becoming a scientist requires the ability to absorb diverse perspectives and then <strong>translate them into your own framework of thought</strong>. Science advances not by repetition, but by reinterpretation.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll focus on the <strong>logic of discovery</strong>, not just the results. You'll read historical milestones and modern papers not to memorize their conclusions, but to understand <strong>how ideas shift when technology lets us see differently</strong>. Recognizing these patterns will help you interpret new findingsâand question old assumptionsâas future paradigms emerge.</p>
<p>Your scientific journey begins not with knowing all the answers, but with learning to <strong>ask better questions</strong>: <em>What do we believe today, and why? What might the next generation see differently?</em></p>
<hr></hr>
<h2 id="the-rapid-pace-of-modern-genetics">The Rapid Pace of Modern Genetics</h2>
<p>Human genetics now changes faster than any other field in biology. New data are produced every day, revealing unexpected insights about how the genome functions. These discoveries influence everythingâfrom basic biology to drug development and personalized medicine.</p>
<p>We're living through a paradigm shiftâfrom gene-centered biology to genome-centered, and now to data-driven, AI-integrated biology. Understanding this transformation is essential for every modern geneticist.</p>
<h3 id="a-changing-era-of-biology">A Changing Era of Biology</h3>
<p>When I was a student in the early 2000s, biology centered around <strong>molecular biology</strong>. At that time, knowing a certain set of facts and mechanisms was enough. But the field has changed dramatically since then. Modern biology now demands a far broader and deeper body of knowledgeânot because the world has become more complicated, but because <strong>our ability to observe and quantify life has expanded enormously</strong>.</p>
<p>For this reason, I'll teach genetics not only from traditional perspectives, but also through the lens of <strong>real, recent data</strong> from current research. This textbook may feel different from older ones that often summarize outdated knowledge. Even familiar conceptsâthose you encountered in high school or introductory biologyâmay look different here, because the language and interpretation of biology itself have evolved.</p>
<p>Some students have said that my lectures feel too computational or mathematical. That's trueâand it reflects how biology has transformed. In the past, biology was largely an <strong>observational science</strong>, relying on what could be seen directly. Now it has become a <strong>quantitative and data-driven discipline</strong>, built upon genome-scale measurements, algorithms, and models. To thrive as future researchers, you'll need to understand these new dimensions of biologyâhow data are generated, analyzed, and ultimately used to build biological meaning.</p>
<p>Keeping up with this progress requires not just reading, but developing the ability to <strong>connect new findings to fundamental concepts</strong>. This book aims to help you build that bridgeâunderstanding how ideas about genes, inheritance, and variation have evolved alongside the technologies that made them visible.</p>
<p>You're entering biology at a remarkable moment: the boundary between experiment, computation, and imagination has never been thinner. Through this course, you'll learn not only what we know, but how knowledge itself continues to evolve.</p>
<hr></hr>
<h2 id="learning-the-language-of-science">Learning the Language of Science</h2>
<p>Scientific papers often feel difficult not because of their content, but because they use a <em>special dialect</em>âwhat we call <strong>scientific jargon</strong>. Every field, every era, and even every research group develops its own preferred terms and expressions. When you read a paper, remember that a single phrase or word is <strong>not a fixed dogma</strong>, but the author's best attempt to describe a complex idea in the language available at that time. Learning to read science means learning to <em>translate</em> these expressionsâto understand the author's intention rather than memorizing the phrasing.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips-for-reading-scientific-papers">Practical Tips for Reading Scientific Papers</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Start with the big picture, not the details.</strong> When you open a paper, read the <strong>title</strong>, <strong>abstract</strong>, and <strong>figure legends</strong> first. Try to understand what question the authors asked and why it mattersânot every technical detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on the question, not the methods.</strong> Beginners often get lost in experimental procedures. Instead, ask: <em>"What were they trying to test?"</em> and <em>"Did their data support that idea?"</em> The logic matters more than the jargon.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read the figures before the text.</strong> Figures are the core of a paper. Even if you don't understand all of them, try to guess what story the figure is telling before reading the legendâit trains scientific reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize that scientific language evolves.</strong> Terminology changes over time, and authors choose expressions that best fit their perspective. A phrase is not a dogmaâit reflects how scientists at that moment understood a phenomenon.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be cautious with secondary sources.</strong> Blogs, media summaries, or portal sites (especially <em>Naver Blog</em> or similar) often oversimplify or distort scientific ideas. Always trace statements back to the <strong>original paper</strong> or a trusted database such as PubMed or NCBI.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wikipedia vs. research papers.</strong> Wikipedia offers consensus knowledgeâa stable background. Papers reflect active discoveryâsometimes uncertain or even contradictory. The difference between them is what makes science dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Annotate as you read.</strong> Write short notes in the margins or keep a glossary of terms you meet repeatedly. Over time, you'll build your own "mini-dictionary" of the field.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don't panic over unknown words.</strong> Even experts meet unfamiliar terms every day. Treat confusion as part of the learning processâit signals that you're exploring new ground.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check "et al." and citation formats.</strong> <em>et al.</em> means <em>"and others."</em> It's used to cite a study with multiple authors, e.g., <em>Kim et al. (2024)</em>. When you write, always include the year and keep the format consistent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reading scientific papers is less about decoding every word and more about <strong>joining an ongoing conversation</strong>. You're learning how scientists reason, argue, and update their understandingânot just how they write.</p>
<p>Reading scientific papers is like learning a new language: you start by recognizing patterns, then begin to understand meaning, and finally gain fluency. Remember that science communicates not through perfect clarity, but through <strong>shared curiosity</strong> and a willingness to keep interpreting.</p>
<hr></hr>
<h2 id="using-ai-to-read-papers-more-effectively">Using AI to Read Papers More Effectively</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be a powerful companion in learning to read scientific papersâbut only if you use it <em>to think with</em>, not <em>to think for you.</em></p>
<p>When you encounter a difficult paper, you can use AI to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize</strong> sections in simpler language and check if you understood them correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Ask "why" and "how" questions</strong>, not just "what." For example: <em>"Why did the authors use RNA-seq instead of microarrays?"</em> or <em>"How does this figure support their main claim?"</em></li>
<li><strong>Compare interpretations.</strong> You can ask the AI how two papers differ in their conclusions or methodsâa skill essential for critical reading.</li>
<li><strong>Translate specialized language.</strong> If a term or phrase feels confusing, let AI explain it in everyday language, then return to the paper and see how that meaning fits in context.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, remember these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>AI cannot replace your judgment.</strong> It can explain what something means, but not decide whether it makes sense. Always verify claims by checking the data and figures in the paper itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid using AI-generated summaries as your only source.</strong> Summaries are interpretations, not neutral facts. If possible, read the original paragraph after the summary to see what nuances were lost.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be critical of citations.</strong> When AI mentions a reference, check whether that study really exists and whether it supports the point being made. This practice trains you to validate informationâa core scientific skill.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use AI to practice paraphrasing.</strong> Try explaining a result in your own words, then ask the AI to review whether your version keeps the meaning. This is how real understanding develops.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="commonly-used-ai-tools-for-learning">Commonly Used AI Tools for Learning</h3>
<p>You can use several large language models (LLMs) to study and discuss scientific papers. Each has slightly different strengths, so it's worth trying a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ChatGPT (OpenAI)</strong>âbalanced general reasoning and academic reading ability.</li>
<li><strong>Gemini (Google)</strong>âstrong integration with Google search and datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Claude (Anthropic)</strong>âexcels in long-text reasoning and paper interpretation.</li>
<li><strong>NotebookLM (Google)</strong>âbest for managing and summarizing multiple uploaded documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tools can assist in reading, summarizing, and questioning research papers. The goal is not to let the AI read <em>for</em> you, but to <strong>learn to read <em>with</em> the AI</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-good-prompts">Writing Good Prompts</h3>
<p>How you ask determines what you learn. A question like "What is A?" can be useful, but a conversation-style approach is often more powerful. You can give the AI context and ask it to explain concepts as if it were a tutor.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of effective prompts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Explain the main idea of this paper as if I were a second-year undergraduate biology student."</li>
<li>"I don't understand how linkage disequilibrium works. Can you explain it using an analogy?"</li>
<li>"Compare how this paper defines gene regulation with how Jacob and Monod described it in the 1960s."</li>
<li>"Summarize this figure in plain Englishâwhat trend is being shown, and what does it mean biologically?"</li>
<li>"Pretend we are having a lab discussion. What questions would you ask about this experiment?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Treat the AI like a study partner: ask follow-up questions, challenge its explanations, and refine your understanding through dialogue.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-ais-limitations">Understanding AI's Limitations</h3>
<p>Even the best AI models make mistakes. Sometimes they <strong>misread parts of a paper</strong> or provide <strong>incomplete interpretations</strong>. This happens because language models have a limit on the number of <em>tokens</em> (the pieces of text) they can read and generate at onceâso they may only "skim" a long article instead of processing it fully.</p>
<p>In addition, AI systems still suffer from <strong>hallucination</strong>âproducing confident but incorrect statements or fabricated references. These errors arise because the model predicts plausible text patterns rather than verifying factual truth.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always <strong>cross-check</strong> AI explanations with the original paper or trusted databases.</li>
<li>Do not rely on AI to do your thinkingâuse it to accelerate your own.</li>
<li>Remember that AI is a <strong>tool to make your work smoother</strong>, not a shortcut to reduce your study time by a hundredfold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading with AI is like discussing a paper with a mentor who never gets tired. Ask boldly, think critically, and never let convenience replace curiosity. The goal is not to read faster, but to <strong>see more deeply</strong>âto evolve your scientific perspective.</p>
<hr></hr>
<h2 id="final-message">Final Message</h2>
<p>Do not fear being wrongâfear not asking. Question everything. Think deeply. Science is not about finding static truths, but about <strong>expanding the ways we understand them</strong>. This book is your starting point for that journey.</p>
